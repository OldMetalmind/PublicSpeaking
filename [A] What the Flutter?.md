v2.0 - "Ready, Set, Flutter"

v3.0 - ["Ready, Set, Flutter!"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vYMpIs9x4S93v2LvjFanpgmADns6MeCo3zUPnlY4cpA/edit?usp=sharing)

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract
The Flutter SDK by Google is the Open Source UI toolkit to create native applications with one codebase.

What is Flutter and why should you care about it? At the end of the talk, you will understand the decisions behind Flutter, why it is so different from other mobile development tools and platforms and why so many developers are addicted to it.

Weâ€™ll start by understanding the architecture of Flutter, the basic elements, and tackling the reason for picking Dart language for developing Flutter. If we have time I will present some code for a Flutter elementary application but I will give more priority to Q&A.

# Story

After the talk "How to Organically grow your community", during the presentation in Madrid for the Pan-EU GDG Summit in end 2018, everyone liked how I talked on how should we not always disclose our dead ponies in regard of being transparent with our problems, so I prepared this talk as a continuation of the "How to organically grow a community" but focused on retention of members.

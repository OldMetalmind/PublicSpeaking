"Lets Build From Source"

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract
What if Google disappeared all of a sudden and it was the Community responsibility to take over the project?  

With this talk I hope to present how to build new widget so that in case you need, you can create your owns, we will go in deep levels on how to build from the ground up the widget you need so that you don't need to wait for others to make them for you.

# Story

One of the most fears of the adoption of Flutter is the answer to the question: "What if Google kills the project" well, for that reason the proejct is open source and so I started my campain to educate everyone in building from source!

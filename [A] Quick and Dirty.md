# Story
As a developer I was always challenged to do things the fastest possible, my clients demanded that, I would only get the best clients because I programmed fast and delivered.

With experience that changed. Development should be done in the right time, with thinking ahead and a correct struture.

Nevertheless I have found that doing programming "Quick and Dirty" has it's advantages and that what I want to talk about.

In this talk I will talk about tools and methods for developing fast without affecting code quality.

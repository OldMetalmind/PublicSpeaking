# Public Speaking
My collections of abstracts, texts, information about my previous tech talks, future and in the making. 

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** (well, I plan on!) to be talking about. Get in touch with me over on Twitter [@abarroso](https://twitter.com/abarroso) :)

I might missing some smaller online or in-person meetups or conferences.

# PublicSpeaking
My collections of abstracts, texts, information about my previous tech talks, future and in the making.

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** (well, I plan on!) to be talking about. Want me to speak about something here? Get in touch with me over on twitter [@abarroso](https://twitter.com/abarroso) :)

# Speaker Bio
My name is Filipe Barroso, I'm a Software Engineer. I love getting out of my zone of comfort, if you don't see me at a tech event, I probabily be planning the next tech event I organize, reading about psychology or preparing my next bit of Standup comedy.

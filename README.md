# Public Speaking
My collections of abstracts, texts, information about my previous tech talks, future and in the making.

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** (well, I plan on!) to be talking about. Want me to speak about something here? Get in touch with me over on twitter [@abarroso](https://twitter.com/abarroso) :)

# Key for file titles

- -: These will be talks which I am looking to give but are still pending submission /approval / rejection

# Speaker Bio
Not your usual software developer, he loves getting out of the zone of comfort and if you don't see him at a tech event, he is probably organizing the next tech event for Google Developer Group Lisbon, that he is an organizer for the last last 3 years, where he organized more than 60 events, 6 of them being full-day conferences. He is always reading about psychology or supporting a local community to grow. He has a strong opinion about social impact, inclusivity and the importance of communities. Lately, he has been advocating the new Flutter SDK by Google, around Portugal, by organizing Flutter Talks and workshops.

As a developer, he has worked in android applications for companies such as Altice, Brisa, Federação Portuguesa Futebol, TAP, Bayer among many others and currently is working remotely as an Android Developer and Machine Learning Engineer.

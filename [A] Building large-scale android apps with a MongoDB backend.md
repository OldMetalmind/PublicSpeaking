# Story

In the beginning 2014 I began working on my startup Ephemera, I was the only developer in a multi-disciplinar team that had everything to work out. After researching, I decided to take a course of MongoDB and determine if it was the best fit for our startup, it was and I feel in love with it.
I began writing the backend and all the calls for our startup and it was amazing.

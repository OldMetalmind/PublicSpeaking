# Story
Two year ago I was given an opportunity to grow a community from ground zero, together with the team organizers and with a goal in mind, we started organizing events such as big conferences, workshops, smaller monthly meetups and such.
To now reach a point where to grow we need to reinforce the alliances that we came to find, with other communities Lisbon.
Communities like ours, that are run by volunteers, free to everyone, strictly community centric and inclusive.
In the last two years, we organizer more than 60 events, 3 of which big conferences of more of 200 people each.

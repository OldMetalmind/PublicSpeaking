# Title

"New kid in the BLoC"

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract
The goal of this talk is that the end of 40 minutes you will have a better understanding of state management in Flutter, through BLoC, InheritedWidget & Scoped model, Redux, and less known MobX. So that in your next Flutter project you will have better confidence in why you pick one and not the other.

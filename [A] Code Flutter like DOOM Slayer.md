# Story

I've been using EMACS for my personal projects, because I use so many laptops and configurations my memory is no longer enough to recall all the hotkeys, so I opted for EMACS and since I'm used to VIM, I was looking for the best of whole world and I found it. DOOM Emacs has the EVIL Mode that makes it possible to use VIM with EMACS and it has been amazing.
